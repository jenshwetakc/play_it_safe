“Although Roblox do monitor the type of language being used, such as profanity, there is no real way of policing the age of players and some users talk in code,” said a mother from Rhondda Cynon Taff, Wales, whose autistic seven-year-old son plays on Roblox regularly.

Nelly*, a mother from Dublin in her 40s, said her nine-year-old daughter had just finished a course of play therapy to process sexual content she saw on Roblox that triggered panic attacks.

Many parents felt Roblox was exploiting children’s “underdeveloped impulse control”, as one father put it, giving them constant nudges to gamble and stay on the platform, and prompting many children to lose interest in other activities in the real world.

“I feel like I’m living with two addicts,” she said. “If they aren’t playing, they want to watch videos about it … When they get told to come off it’s like you’re cutting them off from their last fix – shouting, arguments, sometimes pure rage.”

Peter, 51, an artist from London and father of three boys, said his 14-year-old son had become so addicted to Roblox and his devices generally that he had become violent, and had on one occasion broken a window with his fist when the game had been switched off.

""We came across some pictures,"" she tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""It was horrifying. I was physically sick.""

On third-party apps, he says: ""They can get them to send pictures and hold verbal conversations with them.""

For Amanda Naylor, Barnardo's lead on child sexual abuse, the industry must do more to safeguard children.

She says while Roblox can take action if issues are reported to them, children often do not understand the abuse that is happening to them, so do not report it in the first place.

Last year, a US mother wrote a Facebook post describing her shock at seeing her child's avatar being ""gang raped"" by others in the online game.

One father, Iain, tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme he had similar concerns, after he took control of his son's character to understand more.
